		name : "Cosmos",
		category : "flowers",
		description : "Wispy and delicate, these daisy-shaped flowers seem almost weightless stop their super-long stems (which can grow up to 60 inches tall! Stake them for added support). Wedding florists love to tuck them into otherwise staid bouquets for a bit of happy whimsy; you should do the same for tabletop arrangements."

		description : "Emphatically the king of curries, and perhaps the king of all foods. Spicy, coconutty, sweet and savory. Even the packet sauce you buy from the supermarket can make the most delinquent of cooks look like a Michelin potential. Thankfully, someone invented rice, with which diners can mop up the last drizzles of curry sauce. The Land of Smiles isn't just a marketing catch-line. It's a result of being born in a land where the world's most delicious food is sold on nearly every street corner."

		category : "foods",
		description : "Spare us the lumpy chain monstrosities and everything-on-it wheels of greed. The best pizza was and still is the simple Neapolitan, an invention now protected by its own trade association that insists on sea salt, high-grade wheat flour, the use of only three types of fresh tomatoes, hand-rolled dough and the strict use of a wood-fired oven, among other quality stipulations.

		category : "foods",
		description : "The Mayans drank it, Lasse Hallström made a film about it and the rest of us get over the guilt of eating too much of it by eating more of it. The story of the humble cacao bean is a bona fide out-of-the-jungle, into-civilization tale of culinary wonder. Without this creamy, bitter-sweet confection, Valentine's Day would be all cards and flowers, Easter would turn back into another dull religious event."
